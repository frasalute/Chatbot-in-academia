"Based on the paper, what is the role of employee motivation in the context of absorptive capacity and knowledge transfer within an MNC?"
"Employee motivation plays a pivotal role in the context of absorptive capacity and knowledge transfer within a multinational corporation (MNC). Research indicates that both intrinsic and extrinsic rewards significantly influence employees' willingness to engage in knowledge sharing. Motivated employees are more likely to utilize knowledge from internal resources effectively, 
enhancing the unit's absorptive capacity. This capacity not only facilitates the flow of knowledge but also contributes to improved business performance at the subsidiary level.
Intrinsic motivation, in particular, is linked to effective horizontal knowledge flows between subsidiaries, fostering a cooperative environment that encourages knowledge sharing. Close social ties and a focus on common goals enhance this motivation, making employees more likely to participate in knowledge-sharing activities. However, caution should be exercised with extrinsic rewards, 
as they may undermine intrinsic motivation and deter knowledge sharing. Instead, strategies such as informal recognition can bolster intrinsic motivation without adverse effects.

The study discusses the limitations of previous research that treated absorptive capacity as an exogenous variable. Explain why the authors argue it should be considered endogenous and how knowledge management tools play a role in this.
"The authors argue that absorptive capacity should be considered an endogenous variable because it is influenced by various internal factors within an organization, 
particularly the knowledge management tools that are employed. Unlike the perspective that treats absorptive capacity as an exogenous variable, which suggests it exists independently of the organization's practices, the authors propose that absorptive capacity should be viewed as a dynamic capability that can be shaped and developed through specific interventions.
Knowledge management tools play a crucial role in this context. They act as antecedents that enhance both the motivation and ability of employees to acquire, assimilate, and utilize new knowledge. For instance, the implementation of learning systems, communities of practice, benchmarking, and corporate universities fosters an environment where employees are better equipped to manage incoming knowledge 
inflows. This strategic use of knowledge management tools not only facilitates effective knowledge sharing and collective adaptation but also directly impacts the organization’s absorptive capacity and overall business performance.
By considering absorptive capacity as an endogenous variable influenced by internal processes and interactions, the authors highlight that it is the organization’s practices and culture—not just external factors—that determine how effectively knowledge is absorbed and utilized. This perspective underscores the importance of nurturing an internal environment that supports continuous learning and
knowledge management to enhance organizational capabilities.",2025-04-16 15:28:15.136385
