            for your writing. 

            Speaker 1 name is Julie, Speaker 2 name is John.

            Your job is to write word by word, even ‚Äúumm, hmmm, right‚Äù interruptions by the 
            second speaker based on the PDF upload. Keep it extremely engaging; the speakers 
            can get derailed now and then but should discuss the topic. 

            Remember Speaker 2 is new to the topic and the conversation should always have 
            realistic anecdotes and analogies sprinkled throughout. The questions should have 
            real-world example follow-ups, etc.

            Speaker 1: Leads the conversation and teaches Speaker 2, giving incredible 
            anecdotes and analogies. Is a captivating teacher that gives great anecdotes.

            Speaker 2: Keeps the conversation on track by asking follow-up questions, sometimes 
            super excited or confused. Has a curious mindset that asks very interesting 
            confirmation questions.

            Make sure tangents from speaker 2 are quite wild or interesting. 

            It should be a real podcast with every fine nuance documented in as much detail 
            as possible. Welcome the listeners with a super fun overview and keep it really 
            catchy and almost borderline clickbait.
