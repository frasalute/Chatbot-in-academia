# 🤖 Chatbot-in-Academia

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot that generates academically grounded outputs such as summaries, slide decks, and podcast scripts from research papers. This project compares Meta’s LLaMA 3.3 70B and OpenAI GPT-4o-mini across two retrieval strategies for QA Advanced RAG and Graph RAG and then evaluating non-traditional outputs.

## 🚀 How to Run the Code

1. **Install all dependencies**

   First, install all required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Set your API keys**

   This project requires access to both **Hugging Face** and **OpenAI** models. You need to provide your API keys to use these services.

   Open the relevant Python files and replace the placeholder strings with your actual API keys:

   ```python
   # Example for Hugging Face
   HF_TOKEN = "Your-Hugging-Face-Token"

   # Example for OpenAI
   client = OpenAI(api_key="Your-OpenAI-API-Key")
   ```

   Make sure to update all scripts you intend to use (e.g., `LLama_Summary.py`, `OpenAI_QA.py`, etc.).


3. **Navigate to the project directory and run the desired script**

   Before running any script, make sure you are inside the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd /work/Chatbot-in-academia
   ```

   Then run your desired script, for example:

   ```bash
   python OpenAI_Summary.py
   python LLama_Podcast.py
   python OpenAI_Slidedeck.py
   ```

## 📁 Dataset

Academic papers are sourced from the **CBS Research Archive**.

### To scrape papers:

```bash
python scraping.py 
```
- **Cleaned papers**: papers-cleaned/
- **Test set**: papers-testing/

## 🧠 Model Architecture

| Model         | Type             | Access        | Max Context | Used In                             |
|---------------|------------------|---------------|-------------|-------------------------------------|
| LLaMA 3.3 70B | Open-source LLM  | Hugging Face  | 128K tokens | QA, Summary, Slides, Podcast        |
| GPT-4o-mini   | Proprietary API  | OpenAI        | 128K tokens | QA, Summary, Slides, Podcast        |

### Retrieval Strategies

- **Advanced RAG**: Hybrid (BM25 + Dense Embeddings via ChromaDB)  
- **Graph RAG**: Manual entities and relationships + Knowledge Graph 

---

## 📦 Outputs

- `generated_summary.txt`: Summary of an academic paper  
- `generated_podcast_script.txt`: Scripted podcast dialogue  
- `Podcast_*.mp3`: TTS-generated podcast audio  
- `.pptx` files: PowerPoint slide decks
- different `py.` for QA

---
## 📈 Evaluation Setup

- **Human Evaluators**: 11 CBS students  
- **LLM Judges**: Claude & DeepSeek (no self-evaluation by GPT/LLaMA)

### Output Files

- `Results_Multinational Performance and Risk Management Effects Capital Structure Contingencies`  
- `Results_The impact of knowledge management on MNC subsidiary performance`  
---

## 💬 Use Cases

- 👨‍🏫 **Professors**: Generate lecture-ready slides from academic sources  
- 🎓 **Students**: Listen to podcasts or read summaries for study
