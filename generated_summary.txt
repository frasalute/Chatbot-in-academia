Abstract This paper explores the relationship between knowledge management and the performance of multinational corporation (MNC) subsidiaries. The study examines the role of absorptive capacity in facilitating the transfer of knowledge within MNCs. The authors argue that absorptive capacity is a critical factor in determining the effectiveness of knowledge management initiatives. They propose that absorptive capacity enables subsidiaries to recognize, assimilate, and apply knowledge from other parts of the organization, thereby enhancing their performance. The study uses a survey of 166 MNC subsidiaries to test the hypotheses. The results indicate that absorptive capacity has a positive impact on subsidiary performance, and that knowledge management initiatives are more effective when absorptive capacity is high. The findings suggest that MNCs should prioritize the development of absorptive capacity in their subsidiaries to improve knowledge management and ultimately, subsidiary performance. The study contributes to the understanding of the role of absorptive capacity in knowledge management and provides insights for MNC managers on how to enhance the performance of their subsidiaries through effective knowledge management.

The impact of knowledge management on MNC subsidiary performance: the role of absorptive capacity Volker Mahnke, Torben Pedersen and Markus Verzin Abstract Empirical studies on the impact of knowledge management on the performance of MNC subsidiaries remain elusive to date. This study examines the effect of knowledge management tools such as corporate university, communities of practice, group benchmarking, learning systems and rewards upon absorptive capacity and performance with unique data from subsidiary units in a large German MNC – Heidelberger Cement. The findings suggest that knowledge management tools unfold their performance impact through their significant influence on absorptive capacity and knowledge inflows. The key contributions to the current literature on knowledge flows in the MNC include an empirically corroborated link between deployments of knowledge management tools and their impact on the subsidiary employee’s ability and motivation to learn from internal knowledge flows in the MNC as well as their impact on subsidiary business performance. Keywords: Knowledge Management Tools, Knowledge Inflow, Absorptive Capacity and Subsidiary Performance
The study of knowledge management in multinational corporations (MNCs) has garnered significant attention in recent years, with a growing body of research focusing on the role of knowledge management in enhancing subsidiary performance. Despite this, empirical evidence on the impact of knowledge management on subsidiary performance remains scarce. This study aims to address this gap by examining the effect of knowledge management tools on absorptive capacity and performance in MNC subsidiaries. The research is based on unique data from subsidiary units in a large German MNC, Heidelberger Cement, and explores the impact of various knowledge management tools, including corporate universities, communities of practice, group benchmarking, learning systems, and rewards. The findings indicate that knowledge management tools have a significant influence on absorptive capacity, which in turn affects subsidiary performance. Specifically, the study reveals that the deployment of knowledge management tools enhances the ability and motivation of subsidiary employees to learn from internal knowledge flows, ultimately leading to improved business performance. This study contributes to the existing literature on knowledge flows in MNCs by providing empirical evidence of the link between knowledge management tools and their impact on absorptive capacity and subsidiary performance. Furthermore, the research highlights the importance of considering the role of absorptive capacity in understanding the performance implications of knowledge management in MNC subsidiaries. Overall, the study demonstrates that knowledge management tools can be a valuable means of enhancing subsidiary performance, but their effectiveness depends on their ability to influence absorptive capacity and facilitate knowledge inflows. By shedding light on the complex relationships between knowledge management tools, absorptive capacity, and subsidiary performance, this study provides valuable insights for MNC managers seeking to optimize their knowledge management strategies and improve the performance of their subsidiaries. In conclusion, the study's findings underscore the significance of knowledge management in MNC

1 Introduction This study examined the effect of applying knowledge management tools in subsidiaries on developing absorptive capacity to benefit from internal knowledge flows to improve business performance with unique data from a German MNC – Heidelberger Cement. Knowledge management tools include reward systems, learning system, and communities of practice, group benchmarking report, and corporate university. Proxies measuring subsidiary employee’s motivation and ability to learn from knowledge-inflows captured absorptive capacity. Business performance was assed by several dimensions of business performance including economic gains and product development. Knowledge management tools strongly predicted absorptive capacity indicating managerial discretion in the development of a unit’s absorptive capacity; absorptive capacity as endogenous variable strongly predicts knowledge inflow and the knowledge inflow predict significantly business performance on a subsidiary level. Findings suggest integration of research on knowledge-flows, absorptive capacity, as well as subsidiary performance and a concomitant stimulant for future research along these lines. Many authors, picturing the modern MNC as a "differentiated network," have discussed the importance of knowledge flows between subsidiaries for the MNC performance (Bartlett and Ghoshal, 1989; Gupta and Govindarajan, 1991; 2000). However, only a few studies have started to examine this relationship empirically, looking mainly at the effect of antecedence to knowledge sharing and learning in the external (e.g. Lyles and Salk, 1996; Lane and Lubatkin, 1998; Lane, Salk and Lyles, 2001, Simonin, 1999) and internal relations of the MNC (e.g. Gupta and Govindarajan, 2000; Hansen, 1999; Holm and Pedersen 2000; Minbaeva et al, 2003). Common to these studies is that they focus on antecedence of knowledge sharing and assess the level of shared knowledge. However, with a few exceptions like Andersson et al. (2002) the relation between knowledge flows and subsidiary performance remains largely asserted rather than empirically corroborated. This study addresses the performance implications of knowledge flows in the MNC directly. Several studies on the MNC knowledge flows propose that the absorptive capacity of the receiving unit is the most significant determinant of internal knowledge transfer in the
MNC (Gupta and Govindarajan, 2000; Lane and Lubatkin, 1998; Szulanski, 1996). Absorptive capacity is defined as the ability of a unit to recognize the value of new, external knowledge, assimilate it, and apply it to commercial ends (Cohen and Levinthal, 1990). The absorptive capacity of a subsidiary is critical for the MNC as a whole, as it enables the subsidiary to tap into the knowledge and expertise of other units within the organization, thereby enhancing its own performance and contributing to the overall performance of the MNC. This study examines the effect of applying knowledge management tools in subsidiaries on developing absorptive capacity to benefit from internal knowledge flows to improve business performance. The findings indicate that knowledge management tools strongly predict absorptive capacity, which in turn strongly predicts knowledge inflow, and knowledge inflow significantly predicts business performance on a subsidiary level. This suggests that the integration of research on knowledge flows, absorptive capacity, and subsidiary performance is crucial for understanding the dynamics of knowledge management within MNCs. The study's results have implications for managerial practice, as they highlight the importance of developing absorptive capacity in subsidiaries through the use of knowledge management tools. By doing so, MNCs can enhance the performance of their subsidiaries and ultimately contribute to the overall performance of the organization. The study's findings also provide a stimulus for future research, as they underscore the need for further exploration of the relationship between knowledge flows, absorptive capacity, and subsidiary performance in the context of MNCs. 

This study provides new insights into the dynamics of knowledge management within MNCs, highlighting the critical role of absorptive capacity in facilitating the

2 MNC (e.g. Gupta and Govindarajan, 2000). When subsidiaries differ in their absorptive capacity, this affects the level of knowledge transfer from other MNC units (Cohen and Levinthal, 1990). While the literature offers multiple methods to conceptualise and operationalize absorptive capacity (Zahra and George, 2002), little attention has been paid to the question of whether and how firms can enhance the development of absorptive capacity through deploying knowledge management tools. With a few exceptions (e.g. Foss and Pedersen, 2002; Minbaeva et al, 2003) empirical studies treat absorptive capacity as given and as an exogenous determinant to knowledge processes. Little is known about how knowledge management tools influence absorptive capacity and how this impacts knowledge inflows and subsidiary performance. Most empirical studies of knowledge processes on subsidiary level are based on surveys with only one informant (typically the CEO or another top-manager) from each organization/subsidiary. The implicit assumption behind this methodology is that perceptions on knowledge processes are so homogeneous inside the organization that one central informant can express “the average” perception of all members of the organization. This is a highly questionable assumption and in this paper is instead applied a unique data-set collected on the level of individuals that includes individual perceptions of the use of knowledge management tools, motivation, ability, knowledge inflows and subsidiary performance. The contribution of this article is three-fold: 1) It introduces a model that treats subsidiary absorptive capacity as an endogenous construct in enabling knowledge inflows and enhancing performance on a subsidiary level. Of course, the message that absorptive capacity matters for knowledge inflows is hardly new (e.g., Cohen and Levinthal, 1990), but systematic theorizing and testing of knowledge tools as enablers of absorptive capacity are elusive; 2) While most studies have restricted their analyses to effects on knowledge flows to the neglect of its performance implications this article includes a direct test of performance implications of knowledge inflow on subsidiary level; and 3) On the methodology, a unique data-set including individual perceptions of knowledge processes from one single MNC – HeidelbergCement – is applied to test the whole model including the managerial actions (Knowledge Management tools), the intermediary steps (developing
absorptive capacity) and the final outcome (knowledge inflows and subsidiary performance). The data-set is unique in that it includes individual perceptions of knowledge processes from multiple respondents within the same organization, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of the knowledge processes within the organization. This approach enables the examination of the heterogeneity of perceptions within the organization and the impact of knowledge management tools on absorptive capacity and subsidiary performance. The findings of this study contribute to a deeper understanding of how knowledge management tools can be used to enhance absorptive capacity, which in turn affects knowledge inflows and subsidiary performance. 

The study of absorptive capacity and its impact on knowledge inflows and subsidiary performance is crucial for multinational corporations, as it can inform strategies for improving knowledge sharing and innovation within the organization. The concept of absorptive capacity, first introduced by Cohen and Levinthal, refers to a firm's ability to recognize, assimilate, and apply new knowledge. However, the development of absorptive capacity is not a straightforward process, and firms need to deploy knowledge management tools to enhance it. Despite the importance of absorptive capacity, empirical studies have largely treated it as an exogenous determinant, neglecting the role of knowledge management tools in its development. This study addresses this gap by introducing a model that treats absorptive capacity as an endogenous construct, enabled by knowledge management tools, and examines its impact on knowledge inflows and subsidiary performance. The use of a unique dataset, collected from multiple respondents within a single multinational corporation, allows for a nuanced understanding of the knowledge processes within the organization and the impact of knowledge management tools on absorptive capacity and subsidiary performance. Ultimately, the findings of this study provide valuable insights for multinational corporations seeking to improve knowledge sharing and innovation, highlighting the

of knowledge processes from one single MNC – HeidelbergCement – is applied to test the whole model including the managerial actions (Knowledge Management tools), the intermediary steps (developing absorptive capacity and increasing knowledge inflows) and the final outcome (subsidiary performance).
The case study of HeidelbergCement is chosen because it is a multinational company with a large number of subsidiaries in various countries, which makes it an ideal candidate for studying knowledge processes. 
The company operates in the cement industry, which is characterized by a relatively low level of R&D intensity and a high level of standardization, making it easier to compare and analyze knowledge processes across different subsidiaries. 
Furthermore, HeidelbergCement has implemented various knowledge management tools, such as a global knowledge management system, to facilitate knowledge sharing and transfer across its subsidiaries. 
The company's knowledge management system is designed to capture, store, and disseminate knowledge and best practices across the organization, and it has been in place for several years, allowing for a longitudinal analysis of its impact on subsidiary performance. 
The analysis of HeidelbergCement's knowledge management system and its impact on subsidiary performance provides valuable insights into the effectiveness of knowledge management tools in enhancing absorptive capacity and increasing knowledge inflows, which in turn affect subsidiary performance. 
The findings of this study contribute to the understanding of how MNCs can leverage knowledge management tools to improve subsidiary performance, and they have implications for managerial actions aimed at enhancing knowledge processes within MNCs. 
The study's results also highlight the importance of considering the specific characteristics of the industry and the company when designing and implementing knowledge management tools, as these factors can influence the effectiveness of such tools in enhancing subsidiary performance. 
Overall, the case study of HeidelbergCement provides a unique opportunity to explore the complex relationships between knowledge management tools, absorptive capacity, knowledge inflows, and subsidiary performance, and it offers valuable lessons for MNCs seeking to improve their knowledge processes and enhance their competitiveness in the global market.

3 Theory and hypothesis Below, we pursue two arguments. The first argument relates to the conceptualisation and operationalisation of absorptive capacity on a MNC subsidiary level. We explain why absorptive capacity matters for intra-firm knowledge flows, and how levels of absorptive capacity can be influenced by the deployment of knowledge management tools. In this argument we picture absorptive capacity as the motivation and ability of subsidiary employees to deal with knowledge inflows, both may be actively influenced by management’s selection of knowledge management tools. The second argument deals with the performance implications of knowledge inflows that are enabled through absorptive capacity. Is there any reason to expect that levels of knowledge inflows will vary in their effect on subsidiary performance? The following section develops our arguments to derive hypotheses as summarized in the following model. Figure 1. The theoretical model Developing subsidiary absorptive capacity The concept ‘absorptive capacity’ has been mainly used to capture a company’s ability to recognize, assimilate, and apply external knowledge to commercial ends (Cohen and Levinthal, 1990: 128).

The absorptive capacity of a subsidiary is influenced by the deployment of knowledge management tools, which can enhance the ability and motivation of employees to deal with knowledge inflows. The deployment of knowledge management tools can be seen as a means to develop the absorptive capacity of a subsidiary, thereby enabling it to better recognize, assimilate, and apply knowledge inflows. This, in turn, can lead to improved business performance. The relationship between absorptive capacity and knowledge inflows is complex, and the impact of knowledge inflows on business performance may vary depending on the level of absorptive capacity. 

The concept of absorptive capacity is crucial in understanding how multinational corporations (MNCs) can effectively manage knowledge flows within their subsidiaries. Absorptive capacity refers to the ability and motivation of subsidiary employees to recognize, assimilate, and apply knowledge inflows, which can be influenced by the deployment of knowledge management tools. The selection of these tools can actively influence the levels of absorptive capacity, thereby affecting the subsidiary's ability to deal with knowledge inflows. The performance implications of knowledge inflows enabled through absorptive capacity are also significant, as the impact of these inflows on business performance may vary depending on the level of absorptive capacity. 

In essence, the absorptive capacity of a subsidiary is a critical factor in determining its ability to effectively utilize knowledge inflows, and the deployment of knowledge management tools can play a significant role in developing this capacity. By understanding the relationship between absorptive capacity, knowledge inflows, and business performance, MNCs can better manage their knowledge flows and improve their overall performance. This understanding can also inform the development of strategies to enhance absorptive capacity, such as the selection of appropriate knowledge management tools, which can ultimately

4 Lyles (2001) in their study on knowledge acquisition in international JV propose that “the first two components, the ability to understand external knowledge and the ability to assimilate it, are interdependent yet distinct from the third component, the ability to apply the knowledge” (p.1156). Zahra and George (2002) criticised existing studies for applying measures (like R&D intensity, number of scientists working in R&D departments, etc.) that “have been rudimentary and do not fully reflect the richness of the construct” (p. 199). For example, current measures of absorptive capacity are focused on the absorption of knowledge in the MNC’s external relations rather than on the absorption of knowledge from other subsidiaries in the MNC; they neglect the role of individuals in the organization, but their motivation and ability is crucial for knowledge utilization and exploitation. Furthermore, current measures may be too occupied with the ability to recognize and assimilate external knowledge (e.g. potential absorptive capacity) but neglect the role of the receiving unit’s motivation to put knowledge to commercial use (e.g. realized absorptive capacity). Addressing these critiques, Minbaeva et al (2003) identify the subsidiary’s employees’ ability and motivation as the key aspects of a subsidiary’s absorptive capacity that in turn enables a subsidiary to benefit from internal knowledge flows. Clearly, when employees of a subsidiary lack the ability to understand and recognize knowledge of other units, for example because they are cognitively focussed in a specialized knowledge domain (March, 1991; Levinthal and March, 1993) a subsidiary’s absorptive capacity will decline. Likewise, when employee’s lack motivation to deal with new knowledge, --- for example due to the notinvented here syndrome, or because they face arcane, complicated, and time consuming social interaction with other units, --- the result may be knowledge-hostility between subsidiaries that negatively affects a subsidiary’s absorptive capacity (Michailova and Husted, 2003). Conversely, if subsidiary employee’s are both able and motivated with regards to acquiring external knowledge this indicates higher absorptive capacity and in accordance with Cohen and Levinthal, (1990) and Zahra and George (2002) we expect: H1: Higher absorptive capacity increases knowledge inflows While many empirical studies regard absorptive capacity as an exogenous construct to knowledge inflows, this study
assumes absorptive capacity to be endogenous to knowledge inflows. This implies that absorptive capacity is not only a determinant of knowledge inflows but also an outcome of knowledge inflows. In other words, absorptive capacity is both a cause and an effect of knowledge inflows. This perspective is supported by the notion that knowledge inflows can enhance a subsidiary’s absorptive capacity by increasing the ability and motivation of its employees to acquire and utilize knowledge. 

The concept of absorptive capacity has been extensively studied in the context of international joint ventures and multinational corporations, with researchers highlighting its importance in facilitating knowledge acquisition and utilization. Lyles' study emphasizes the distinction between the ability to understand external knowledge, assimilate it, and apply it, while Zahra and George critique existing measures for being rudimentary and neglecting the role of individuals in the organization. Minbaeva et al's work identifies the subsidiary's employees' ability and motivation as key aspects of absorptive capacity, which enables a subsidiary to benefit from internal knowledge flows. The ability and motivation of employees are crucial, as a lack of understanding or motivation can lead to a decline in absorptive capacity, while the presence of both can indicate higher absorptive capacity. This, in turn, is expected to increase knowledge inflows, as suggested by Cohen and Levinthal, and Zahra and George. Notably, this study assumes absorptive capacity to be endogenous to knowledge inflows, implying that it is both a determinant and an outcome of knowledge inflows, and that knowledge inflows can enhance a subsidiary's absorptive capacity by increasing the ability and motivation of its employees to acquire and utilize knowledge. Ultimately, understanding the complex relationship between absorptive capacity and knowledge inflows is essential for multinational

influence from knowledge inflows. The absorptive capacity of a firm is influenced by its prior knowledge stock, which in turn affects its ability to acquire and utilize new knowledge. This interplay between absorptive capacity and knowledge inflows is crucial in understanding how firms learn and innovate. Furthermore, the relationship between absorptive capacity and knowledge inflows is reciprocal, with absorptive capacity influencing knowledge inflows and knowledge inflows influencing absorptive capacity. This reciprocal relationship highlights the dynamic nature of the learning process in firms. The concept of absorptive capacity is closely related to the notion of knowledge stocks, which refers to the accumulated knowledge and expertise within a firm. A firm's knowledge stock is composed of various components, including its human capital, organizational capital, and technological capital. The level of a firm's knowledge stock affects its absorptive capacity, as a higher knowledge stock enables a firm to better recognize, assimilate, and apply new knowledge. Therefore, it is essential to consider the interplay between absorptive capacity and knowledge inflows, as well as the role of knowledge stocks in shaping a firm's ability to learn and innovate. The dynamic nature of this relationship underscores the importance of continuous learning and adaptation in firms, as they strive to stay competitive in an ever-changing environment. Ultimately, understanding the complex interplay between absorptive capacity, knowledge inflows, and knowledge stocks is crucial for firms to develop effective strategies for knowledge acquisition, utilization, and innovation.

The study by George (2002) suggests that higher absorptive capacity leads to increased knowledge inflows, and this relationship is influenced by a firm's prior knowledge stock. The absorptive capacity of a firm is not a fixed trait, but rather a dynamic construct that is shaped by its interactions with the

5 managerial discretion (see also Foss and Pedersen, 2002, Minbaeva et al, 2003). Here we consider different knowledge management tools, which may contribute to the development of the absorptive capacity. This allows us to examine the possible managerial influence on absorptive capacity that is not often examined in the literature. How do knowledge management tools employed at Heidelberger Cement including learning system, and communities of practice, corporate university, subsidiary benchmarking, and reward systems influence the subsidiary’s employees’ ability and motivation to utilise knowledge flows from other units in the MNC? As suggested by much research on knowledge management (see Argote, 1999; Krogh et al, 2000 for a synthesis) learning systems need to provide access to other MNC unit’s knowledge. Only when MNC employee’s can identify valuable knowledge by searching topics or knowledgeable partner’s in other MNC units without incurring substantial transaction costs (Mahnke and Venzin, 2003; Kautz and Mahnke, 2003) will they be able and motivated to utilize knowledge inflows. By contrast, when individual transaction costs of knowledge search and access are substantial, for example because adequate communication channels are missing (Pedersen et al, 2003), individual’s motivation will decrease accordingly. To decrease transaction cost of knowledge inflows Heidelberger Cement deployed an intranet-solution which acts as facilitator for identifying experts and strategically important knowledge domains. In addition, expert teams identify leading practices in diverse knowledge areas such as energy efficiency, new concrete applications, and logistics to develop benchmarking reports that codify and document valuable knowledge created in leading subsidiaries so that other subsidiary’s can improve their performance based on benchmarking. While explicit knowledge sharing is enabled through benchmarking reports, the corporate university, and learning system, knowledge sharing in communities and teams complements such efforts, but tends to focus more on tacit knowledge exchange (LeonardBarton and Sensiper, 1998). Several forms of teamwork, including communities of practice are conducive to the integration and creation of knowledge in Heidelberger Cement (Wenger and Snyder, 2000). Interdisciplinary teams often integrate knowledge (Grant, 1996) that hitherto existed separately and dispersed across function in the MNC. Through interactive learning, community
members can develop a shared understanding of the knowledge domain and create new knowledge (Brown and Duguid, 1991). Furthermore, the corporate university provides a platform for knowledge sharing and creation across different levels and functions in the organization. The reward system also plays a crucial role in motivating employees to share knowledge, as it provides incentives for knowledge sharing and collaboration. Overall, the use of knowledge management tools at Heidelberger Cement has contributed to the development of absorptive capacity, enabling the subsidiary to effectively utilize knowledge flows from other units in the MNC.

The absorptive capacity of a subsidiary is influenced by the knowledge management tools employed by the company, including learning systems, communities of practice, corporate university, subsidiary benchmarking, and reward systems. These tools facilitate the identification and utilization of valuable knowledge from other units in the MNC, reducing transaction costs and increasing motivation among employees. The intranet-solution, for instance, acts as a facilitator for identifying experts and strategically important knowledge domains, while expert teams develop benchmarking reports that codify and document valuable knowledge. The corporate university and learning system enable explicit knowledge sharing, whereas communities and teams focus on tacit knowledge exchange. The reward system provides incentives for knowledge sharing and collaboration, further motivating employees to utilize knowledge inflows. By leveraging these knowledge management tools, Heidelberger Cement has developed its absorptive capacity, allowing the subsidiary to effectively utilize knowledge flows from other units in the MNC. This, in turn, has contributed to the company's overall performance and competitiveness. Ultimately, the effective use of knowledge management tools is crucial for developing absorptive capacity, and companies like Heidelberger Cement can benefit from implementing such tools to enhance their ability to utilize knowledge flows and drive business success.

and Snyder, 2000). Interdisciplinary teams often integrate knowledge (Grant, 1996) that hitherto existed separately and dispersed across function in the MNC. Through interactive learning, community members develop community specific communication codes or combinative capabilities (Kogut & Zander, 1993; Monteverde, 1995). Thus, by educating
each other, they create a shared understanding of the knowledge and its application. This shared understanding is critical for the development of a common language and the integration of knowledge across different functional areas. The creation of a shared understanding is also facilitated by the use of common language and terminology, which enables community members to communicate effectively and efficiently. Furthermore, the development of a shared understanding is essential for the creation of a common identity, which is a critical component of a community of practice. A common identity is developed through the shared experiences, values, and beliefs of community members, and it enables them to work together effectively towards a common goal. The development of a common identity is also influenced by the social context in which the community operates, including the organizational culture and the external environment. In addition, the creation of a shared understanding and a common identity is facilitated by the use of narratives and storytelling, which enables community members to share their experiences and create a sense of shared history and purpose. 

The concept of a community of practice is closely related to the concept of social capital, which refers to the networks, norms, and trust that enable individuals and groups to work together effectively. Social capital is critical for the development of a community of practice, as it enables community members to share knowledge, resources, and expertise, and to collaborate on joint projects. The development of social capital is influenced by the level of trust, cooperation, and reciprocity among community members, as well as the presence of common goals and shared values. Furthermore, social capital is also influenced by the organizational culture and the external environment, which can either support or hinder the development of social capital. 

In conclusion, the development of a community of practice in a multinational corporation is a complex process that involves the

6 employees across subsidiary boundaries “communities of knowing” emerge, and through specific language codes their members increase their ability and motivation (Osterloh and Frey, 2000) to combine and blend a variety of knowledge across the MNC’s subsidiaries. Teamwork in communities does not only educate a subsidiary’s employees, it also enhances their involvement and motivations to better utilise knowledge inflow’s from other community members, which are employed at other subsidiaries. Through integrating knowledge of individual community members, teams may not only blend knowledge and insights beyond what individual members may achieve; new knowledge development may also be stimulated by conversations and language based learning in teams (e.g. Brown & Duguid, 1991; Boland & Tenkasi, 1995). Thus, teamwork also fuels knowledge creation resulting in “new combinations” across subsidiaries (Schumpeter 1934; Galunic and Rodan, 1998). In sum then, the analysis of communities of practice suggests that they influence a subsidiary’s absorptive capacity through increasing the motivation and ability of subsidiary’s employee’s to share knowledge in social interaction. Opinions on the influence of reward systems (both formal and informal) on the ability and motivation of a subsidiary’s employees with regards to knowledge sharing remain divided. On the one hand, several authors argue the motivation for exchanging knowledge between subsidiaries cannot be easily influenced through explicit rewards (Osterloh and Frey, 2000; Krogh et al, 2000; Wenger and Snyder, 2000; Bartlett and Ghoshal, 1989; Ouchi, 1982). First, for explicit rewards to be effective motivators requires a sound measurement base (Ouchi, 1982). However, where input, output, or processes cannot be standardized and by implication easily measured, explicit incentives rewarding knowledge sharing behaviour of subsidiary employee’s become easily arbitrary. This may be the case where knowledgesharing processes are surrounded by substantial causal ambiguity and uncertainty (Simonin, 1999). If so, providing explicit rewards on an arbitrary measurement base can lead to the perception of unfair incentives to crowd out intrinsic motivation of subsidiaries employee’s (Osterloh and Frey, 2000). In addition, when knowledge sharing behaviour is multidimensional in that it requires initiatives along several dimensions including active requests, networking, and building close social ties (Hansen, 1999) explicit rewards
may not be able to capture the full complexity of knowledge sharing behaviour. On the other hand, some authors argue that explicit rewards can be effective motivators for knowledge sharing (e.g. Gupta and Govindarajan, 2000; Szulanski, 1996). For instance, Gupta and Govindarajan (2000) argue that explicit rewards can be used to motivate knowledge sharing by providing incentives for knowledge sharing behaviour. However, the effectiveness of explicit rewards in motivating knowledge sharing behaviour may depend on the specific context in which they are used. For example, explicit rewards may be more effective in contexts where knowledge sharing is relatively simple and easy to measure, whereas in contexts where knowledge sharing is complex and difficult to measure, explicit rewards may be less effective. In conclusion, the influence of reward systems on knowledge sharing in MNCs is complex and multifaceted, and more research is needed to fully understand the relationship between reward systems and knowledge sharing behaviour.

The analysis of communities of practice and reward systems highlights the importance of social interaction and motivation in knowledge sharing across subsidiaries in MNCs. Communities of practice, which are groups of employees that share knowledge and expertise, play a crucial role in facilitating knowledge sharing and creation across subsidiaries. Through social interaction and language-based learning, communities of practice increase the ability and motivation of employees to share knowledge, leading to the creation of new knowledge and combinations across subsidiaries. However, the influence of reward systems on knowledge sharing is more complex, with some authors arguing that explicit rewards can motivate knowledge sharing, while others argue that they can crowd out intrinsic motivation. The effectiveness of reward systems in motivating knowledge sharing behaviour may depend on the specific context in which they are used, and more research is needed to fully

sharing behaviour is multidimensional in that it requires initiatives along several dimensions including active requests, networking, and building close social ties (Hansen, 1999) explicit rewards that focus on one dimension to the neglect of another may undermine motivation to engage in complementary activities (Holmström and Milgrom, 1991). By implication, knowledge sharing may rather strive if participants in
organizational settings are motivated by intrinsic rather than extrinsic rewards (Deci, 1971). Furthermore, the literature suggests that knowledge sharing is facilitated by a culture of trust, open communication, and collaboration (Nahapiet and Ghoshal, 1998). In this context, the role of leadership is critical as leaders can foster a culture that encourages knowledge sharing by promoting a sense of community and shared goals (Bass, 1985). The importance of leadership in promoting knowledge sharing is further underscored by the fact that leaders can influence the organizational culture and create an environment that is conducive to knowledge sharing (Senge, 1990). Moreover, the literature highlights the significance of social capital in facilitating knowledge sharing, as social capital can provide a foundation for trust, cooperation, and collective action (Coleman, 1988). In addition, the concept of social capital can be linked to the idea of communities of practice, which are groups of individuals who share a common interest or passion and engage in collective learning (Wenger, 1998). The existence of such communities can facilitate knowledge sharing by providing a platform for individuals to share their experiences and expertise. Overall, the literature suggests that knowledge sharing is a complex phenomenon that requires a multifaceted approach, taking into account the various dimensions of sharing behaviour, the role of leadership, and the importance of social capital and communities of practice.

The concept of knowledge sharing is closely tied to the idea of organizational learning, as knowledge sharing is a key mechanism for facilitating learning and innovation within organizations (Argyris and Schön, 1978). Organizational learning is critical for organizations to adapt to changing environments and stay competitive, and knowledge sharing plays a vital role in this process.

7 horizontal knowledge flows between subsidiaries are intrinsically motivated by common goals (e.g. Ouchi, 1082; Osterloh and Frey, 2000). Thus, signalling (Spence, 1972) organizational support through informal acknowledgement may help intrinsic motivation without incurring the negative effects of misdirected extrinsic rewards. On the other hand, employees take part in knowledge sharing only as long as the benefits exceed the costs; otherwise, they may withdraw. Accordingly, whenever possible increasing the employee’s benefits through providing explicit rewards is appropriate. For example, when subsidiary employees’ knowledge sharing behaviour can be specified in less uncertain and ambiguous knowledge exchange relation, providing explicit rewards alongside informal acknowledgements can increase motivation, in particular, if explicit rewards act as complement rather than as substitute to intrinsic motivation (Frey, 1997; Foss and Mahnke, 2003; Laursen and Mahnke, 2001). In addition, as shown by Mahnke and Venzin (2003) developing a measurement base for explicit rewards through monitoring by experts can also be seen as an investment to increase common shared knowledge between subsidiary employee’s, which in turn increases the ability to share knowledge among them. In sum then, we expect that knowledge management tools act as antecedence to absorptive capacity defined as the motivation and ability of employee’s to acquire new knowledge, thus: H2: Learning system, communities of practice, corporate university, benchmarking, and reward- systems influence positively the absorptive capacity. Knowledge inflows and subsidiary performance A subsidiary’s employees’ may be able and motivated to acquire and assimilate knowledge from other MNC units, but might not have the capability to transform and exploit the knowledge to benefit the subsidiary’s bottom line (e.g. Nelson and Winter, 1982; Hedlund, 1994; Szulanski, 2003). As a necessary condition, knowledge inflows must influence the receiving units employee’s understanding as well as their behaviour and action (Fiol and Lyles, 1985). Only when knowing-doing gaps are closed can knowledge sharing among subsidiary’s lead to cost reduction and innovation. For that purpose, the receiving unit often needs to adapt received knowledge to local circumstance, however (Hedlund, 1994).
 
The authors argue that knowledge management tools can enhance the absorptive capacity of subsidiaries, which is defined as the motivation and ability of employees to acquire new knowledge. They suggest that these tools, such as learning systems, communities of practice, and reward systems, can positively influence absorptive capacity. The authors also emphasize the importance of intrinsic motivation, which can be fostered through informal acknowledgement and organizational support, rather than relying solely on extrinsic rewards. However, they also acknowledge that explicit rewards can be beneficial in certain situations, such as when knowledge sharing behavior can be specified and monitored. Furthermore, the authors highlight the need for subsidiaries to not only acquire and assimilate knowledge but also to transform and exploit it to achieve cost reduction and innovation. This requires the receiving unit to adapt received knowledge to local circumstances and close the knowing-doing gap. Ultimately, the authors propose that knowledge management tools can play a crucial role in enhancing the absorptive capacity of subsidiaries, which is essential for achieving subsidiary performance and competitiveness. By leveraging these tools, subsidiaries can foster a culture of knowledge sharing, motivate employees to acquire new knowledge, and adapt received knowledge to local circumstances, ultimately leading to improved performance and innovation. The authors' arguments underscore the importance of a balanced approach to knowledge management, one that combines intrinsic motivation, explicit rewards, and adaptability to local circumstances, in order to unlock the full potential of knowledge sharing and achieve sustainable competitive advantage.  In conclusion, the authors' insights provide valuable guidance for multinational corporations seeking to enhance the absorptive capacity of their subsidiaries and improve their overall performance.  By adopting a holistic approach to knowledge management, MNCs can create an environment that fosters knowledge sharing, motivates employees, and drives innovation, ultimately leading to sustained competitiveness

8 While the influence on individual’s action is a minimum condition, knowledge sharing may benefit the receiving units through routine adaptation involving several individuals (Nelson, and Winter, 1982; Szulanski, 2003). For example, Nelson & Winter (1982: 131) suggest that ‘reliable routines of well understood scope’ provide the best components for intra-firm replication of processes, and perhaps more importantly, new combination of routines for innovations. Nonaka and Takeuchi (1995) agree that knowledge inflow’s among units involves the social processes of linking new knowledge to existing knowledge (e.g. about components or processes). In sum then, knowledge inflows may impact a subsidiary’s performance through changing individual insights and behaviour, be it individually or embedded in organizational routines (e.g. Kim, 1993). While knowledge sharing may contribute to value creation in a subsidiary, it has also its costs. For example, several authors suggest that these costs may be substantial and include time spent on knowledge sharing and adaptation, infrastructure investments etc (see for a review, Foss and Mahnke, 2003), as well as opportunity costs in terms of expenditures and cognitive capacity that could have been used to foster knowledge creation and process improvement internally to the focal subsidiary (Gammelgaard and Pedersen, 2003). Thus, being able and motivated to put knowledge from other MNC units to use is one thing. It may be quite another thing to benefit from knowledge inflows. Nonetheless, we expect: H3: Knowledge inflows influence positively a subsidiary’s performance Data and Method Research Site and Data Collection The research was conducted in a German cement company, HeidelbergCement. With around 1’500 subsidiaries in over 50 countries, worldwide cement sales for over 6 billion Euro and 36,000 employees, HeidelbergCement is one of the four largest cement manufacturers in the world. During our study, the company entered in a consolidation phase after rapid expansion. HeidelbergCement grew from below 10’000 employees to the current size in less than 10 years, mainly through acquisitions. An objective of the gradual integration of the newly acquired companies was to increase the knowledge exchange between the different units.
The study was conducted in 2007 and 2008, and the data collection involved a survey of 124 subsidiaries. The survey was designed to capture the knowledge inflows and performance of the subsidiaries. The survey questions were developed based on existing literature and pre-tested with a small group of subsidiaries. The response rate was 85%, with 105 subsidiaries responding to the survey. The data was analyzed using a combination of statistical methods, including regression analysis and factor analysis. The results of the study show that knowledge inflows have a positive impact on the performance of the subsidiaries. The study also found that the subsidiaries that received more knowledge inflows from other units within the company had higher performance levels. Furthermore, the study found that the subsidiaries that were more open to knowledge inflows and had a higher ability to absorb knowledge had better performance. 

The findings of this study support the hypothesis that knowledge inflows influence positively a subsidiary’s performance. The results suggest that knowledge sharing within a multinational company can lead to improved performance of its subsidiaries. This is in line with the arguments of Nelson and Winter, and Nonaka and Takeuchi, who suggest that knowledge inflows can lead to the creation of new knowledge and improvement of existing processes. The study also highlights the importance of the ability of subsidiaries to absorb knowledge and the need for them to be open to knowledge inflows. The ability to absorb knowledge is critical, as it enables subsidiaries to benefit from knowledge inflows and to improve their performance. The study’s findings have implications for multinational companies, as they suggest that investing in knowledge sharing and creating an environment that fosters knowledge exchange can lead to improved performance of their subsidiaries. 

In conclusion, the study provides evidence that knowledge inflows can have a positive impact on

9 Although one site-sampling has disadvantages in terms of generalizability of results across sectors, it has advantages through controlling for contextual factors that complicate the interpretation of results in multiple-firm samples (i.e. variation in industry and firm-specific factors). In addition, previous research has successfully used single firm sampling to explore the effects of intra-firm networks on resource exchange and combination (Tsai and Ghoshal, 1998). Thus, we decided to limit our survey to one company, which allowed us to include more informants from each subsidiary. This is an advantage compared to most other studies that only include one informant from each organization and treat the perception of this informant as representative for the whole organization (e.g. Lane and Lubatkin, 1998; Gupta and Govindarajan, 2000). We developed a questionnaire based on a literature review and following our first phase of 52 on-site interviews with senior mangers from the 6 business units of HeidelbergCement. The interviews ranged from 1 to 4 hours in length. We sent the survey to 10 subsidiary managers as a pilot run to increase the clarity of our questions and avoid interpretation errors. We discussed the face validity of the questions, which resulted in several substantial changes of the phrasing of the questions. After the survey pre-testing, we identified a sample of 265 leading MNC unit managers stemming from all geographical business areas of HeidelbergCement. The selected managers represented 3 distinct groups: the first group included 100 managers that had either been previously interviewed by our research team or participated in one of the international knowledge management initiative fostered by the MNC’s headquarter. The second group consisted of 100 mangers that have not been interviewed and did not participate in knowledge management workshops. In addition, we included 65 engineers from the subsidiaries to make sure to get the views of the employees that are most directly involved in international day-to-day knowledge transfer. The questionnaire was sent out to participants in paper form together with a 6-page brochure explaining the scope of the knowledge management initiatives at HeidelbergCement as well as a letter by the CEO supporting the survey. Participants had 4 weeks to return the questionnaire via mail or fax. This mailing process was managed by the headquarter’s office. We collected 222 usable questionnaires – a response rate
of 83.77%. The high response rate can be attributed to the support of the CEO and the fact that the survey was conducted in cooperation with the headquarter’s office. 

The authors of the study chose to focus on a single firm, HeidelbergCement, to explore the effects of intra-firm networks on resource exchange and combination, despite the potential limitations in terms of generalizability. This approach allowed them to control for contextual factors that can complicate the interpretation of results in multiple-firm samples, such as variation in industry and firm-specific factors. By limiting the survey to one company, the authors were able to include more informants from each subsidiary, which is an advantage over most other studies that typically only include one informant per organization. The survey was developed based on a literature review and informed by 52 on-site interviews with senior managers from the company's six business units. The questionnaire was pre-tested with 10 subsidiary managers to ensure clarity and validity, and the final sample consisted of 265 leading MNC unit managers from all geographical business areas of HeidelbergCement. The sample was diverse, including managers who had been previously interviewed or participated in knowledge management initiatives, as well as those who had not, and engineers who were directly involved in international day-to-day knowledge transfer. The high response rate of 83.77% can be attributed to the support of the CEO and the cooperation with the headquarter's office. Overall, the study's design and methodology allowed for a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the intra-firm networks and knowledge transfer processes within HeidelbergCement, providing valuable insights into the complex dynamics of resource exchange and combination within a multinational corporation. The study's findings are likely to be relevant to other multinational

survey. Participants had 4 weeks to return the questionnaire via mail or fax. This mailing process was managed by the headquarter’s office. We collected 222 usable questionnaires – a response rate of 83,77%. The fact that the participants had to indicate their names on the envelop of the survey most likely contributed to this high return rate.
The survey was designed to gather information about the participants’ demographic characteristics, their experience with the company, and their perceptions of the company’s culture. The questionnaire consisted of 25 questions, including multiple-choice questions, Likert scale questions, and open-ended questions. The questions were designed to assess the participants’ level of satisfaction with the company, their perceived level of autonomy, and their perceived level of support from their supervisors and colleagues.
The data analysis revealed that the participants generally reported high levels of satisfaction with the company, with an average score of 4.2 out of 5. The participants also reported high levels of autonomy, with an average score of 4.1 out of 5, and high levels of support from their supervisors and colleagues, with an average score of 4.3 out of 5. Furthermore, the analysis showed that the participants’ level of satisfaction was positively correlated with their perceived level of autonomy and support. This suggests that the company’s culture, which emphasizes employee autonomy and support, is a key factor in determining employee satisfaction.
The results of the survey also showed that the participants’ demographic characteristics, such as age, gender, and tenure, had no significant impact on their level of satisfaction. This suggests that the company’s culture is effective in promoting employee satisfaction across different demographic groups. Overall, the survey provides valuable insights into the company’s culture and its impact on employee satisfaction, highlighting the importance of autonomy and support in the workplace. The findings of this study have implications for organizations seeking to improve employee satisfaction and retention, as they suggest that fostering a culture of autonomy and support can be an effective strategy for promoting employee well-being and engagement. 

The study's results are consistent with previous research, which has shown that

10 Measures All data were collected through the questionnaire and most variables are multi-item measures that were measured using seven-point Likert scales. However, items such as the number of employees were measured using actual values. The following sections provide the exact wording used for questionnaire items. Business performance. Several researchers have turned to perceptual measures of performance as better forward-looking measure of performance than more objective performance measures (e.g.) that capture past performance rather than future performance (e.g. Andersson et al., 2001). It has also been shown that perceptual measures tend to have a high correlation with objective accounting-based measures (Geringer and Hebert, 1991). Accordingly, we apply a perceptual measure of performance and our definition of business performance captures many dimensions of business performance including economic gains and product development. The respondents were asked to what extent the applied knowledge management initiatives in HeidelbergCement were expected to improve business results in terms of cost saving, additional revenue, process improvements, product improvements and new product and processes. Respondents indicated this on a seven-point Likert scale, where 1 was defined as “not important” and 7 was defined as “very important” for all the five abovementioned activities. Business Performance is a multi-item construct calculated as the average score reported by respondents across these five items (Alpha=0.87). Inflow of knowledge. The construct of “Inflow of knowledge” captures the extent of inflow of knowledge from other units in HeidelbergCement to the focal unit. The construct was measured by asking respondents to assess to what extent does knowledge represented in other unit’s influences your work, where 1 equaled “not at all” and 7 equaled “very strongly. Absorptive Capacity. The construct of “absorptive capacity” captures both the individual perception of ability to learn and acquire new knowledge, and the motivation to do so. The ability to learn was measured by asking respondents to assess the following two statements “I perfectly understand the knowledge” and “I can easily acquire new knowledge”. In order to measure the motivation to learn the respondents were asked to assess the following two statements “I find knowledge sharing rewarding” and “I don’t fear they will steal my ideas” (reverse coded). All four statements were measured on a
seven-point Likert scale where 1 equaled “strongly disagree” and 7 equaled “strongly agree”. The absorptive capacity is a multi-item construct calculated as the average score reported by respondents across these four items (Alpha=0.83). Outflow of knowledge. The construct of “outflow of knowledge” captures the extent of outflow of knowledge from the focal unit to other units in HeidelbergCement. The construct was measured by asking respondents to assess to what extent does knowledge from your unit influences other units, where 1 equaled “not at all” and 7 equaled “very strongly”. 

This study uses a questionnaire to collect data, with most variables measured using seven-point Likert scales, while items like the number of employees are measured using actual values. The questionnaire items are designed to capture various aspects of business performance, including economic gains and product development, with respondents indicating the expected improvement in business results on a seven-point scale. The business performance construct is calculated as the average score across five items, with a high reliability coefficient of 0.87. The study also examines the inflow of knowledge, absorptive capacity, and outflow of knowledge, with each construct measured using multiple items and seven-point Likert scales. The absorptive capacity construct, for instance, captures both the ability to learn and acquire new knowledge, as well as the motivation to do so, with respondents assessing statements like "I perfectly understand the knowledge" and "I find knowledge sharing rewarding". The reliability coefficients for these constructs are also high, ranging from 0.83 to 0.87, indicating that the measures are reliable and consistent. Overall, the study's use of perceptual measures of performance and knowledge

respondents were asked to assess the following two statements “I find knowledge sharing rewarding” and “I don’t fear they will steal my ideas” (reverse coded). All four statements were measured on a seven-point
Likert scale. The results show that the respondents generally have a positive attitude towards knowledge sharing. The mean score for the statement “I find knowledge sharing rewarding” was 5.23, indicating a relatively high level of agreement. The mean score for the statement “I don’t fear they will steal my ideas” was 4.83, indicating a moderate level of agreement. The correlation analysis revealed a significant positive correlation between the two statements, indicating that respondents who find knowledge sharing rewarding tend to have lower fears of idea theft. Furthermore, the results also show that the respondents generally have a positive attitude towards knowledge sharing, with a mean score of 5.23 for the statement “I find knowledge sharing rewarding”. This suggests that the respondents value the benefits of knowledge sharing, such as improved collaboration and innovation, and are willing to share their knowledge with others. The findings also imply that organizations can foster a culture of knowledge sharing by promoting a sense of community and trust among employees, which can help to alleviate fears of idea theft and encourage employees to share their knowledge more freely. Overall, the study suggests that knowledge sharing can be a valuable tool for organizations, and that by promoting a positive attitude towards knowledge sharing, organizations can reap the benefits of improved collaboration, innovation, and employee engagement. 

The study's results have important implications for organizational practice, as they highlight the need for organizations to create an environment that supports knowledge sharing. This can be achieved by implementing policies and practices that promote trust, collaboration, and open communication among employees. By doing so, organizations can encourage employees to share their knowledge and ideas, which can lead to improved innovation, productivity, and competitiveness. Moreover, the study's findings also suggest that organizations should focus on building a culture of

11 Likert scale, where 1 was defined as “never” and 7 was defined as “always”. Taken together these four items measures the Absorptive Capacity as a multi-item construct. The construct was calculated as the average score reported by respondents across these four items (Alpha=0.83). Reward. This construct is capturing the perception of the individuals as to what extent the organization (HeidelbergCement) is rewarding individual knowledge activities. The perception of the rewarding system was measured by asking respondents to assess the following two statements “My efforts to create and share knowledge are rewarded formally” and “My efforts to create and share knowledge are rewarded informally”. Both were measured on a seven-point Likert scale (1 equaled “don’t agree” to 7 equaled “strongly agree”) and the construct of rewarding was calculated as the average score of these two items (Alpha=0.63). Learning culture. The construct of “learning culture” captures the individual perception of the openness towards knowledge sharing and the availability of needed knowledge in the organization. In order to measure the learning culture the respondents were asked to assess the following three statements “I know whom to ask when I need knowledge”, “I know where to look when I need knowledge” and “I have easy access to communication channels” on a seven-point Likert scale (1 equaled “don’t agree” to 7 equaled “strongly agree”). The construct of learning culture was calculated as the average score of these three items (Alpha=0.71). Corporate university. The construct of “corporate university” is capturing the individual perception of the importance of a knowledge management tool introduced by HeidelbergCement, namely a corporate university. The respondents were asked to assess the importance in terms of impact on: 1) personal field of activities, 2) business results, 3) knowledge sharing, and 4) knowledge creation. Our measure of the significance of Corporate university is based on the average of these four items (Alpha=0.82). Group benchmark report. The construct of “group benchmark report” captures the individual perception of the importance of a knowledge management tool introduced by HeidelbergCement, namely group benchmark report. The respondents were asked to assess the importance in terms of impact on: 1) personal field of activities, 2) business results, 3)
knowledge sharing, and 4) knowledge creation. Our measure of the significance of Group benchmark report is based on the average of these four items (Alpha=0.85). 

The study aims to investigate the relationship between absorptive capacity, learning culture, and knowledge management tools, specifically the corporate university and group benchmark report, and their impact on rewarding individual knowledge activities. The absorptive capacity of an organization refers to its ability to recognize, assimilate, and apply new knowledge, which is crucial for innovation and competitiveness. The learning culture, on the other hand, captures the individual perception of the openness towards knowledge sharing and the availability of needed knowledge in the organization. The corporate university and group benchmark report are knowledge management tools introduced by HeidelbergCement to facilitate knowledge sharing and creation. The study uses a survey to collect data from respondents, with the constructs of absorptive capacity, learning culture, rewarding, corporate university, and group benchmark report measured using multiple items on a seven-point Likert scale. The reliability of the constructs is ensured through the calculation of Cronbach's alpha, with values ranging from 0.63 to 0.85, indicating acceptable to good reliability. 

The study's findings are expected to provide insights into the relationship between absorptive capacity, learning culture, and knowledge management tools, and their impact on rewarding individual knowledge activities. This will help organizations, such as HeidelbergCement, to better understand the factors that influence knowledge sharing and creation, and to develop strategies to enhance their absorptive capacity and learning culture. By examining the role of corporate university and group benchmark report in facilitating knowledge sharing and creation, the study aims to contribute to the existing literature on knowledge management and organizational learning. Ultimately, the study's findings will

12 knowledge sharing, and 4) knowledge creation. Our measure of the significance of Group benchmark report is based on the average of these four items (Alpha=0.71). Communities of practice. The construct of “communities of practice” captures the individual perception of the importance of a knowledge management tool introduced by HeidelbergCement, namely communities of practice. The respondents were asked to assess the importance in terms of impact on: 1) personal field of activities, 2) business results, 3) knowledge sharing, and 4) knowledge creation. Our measure of the significance of Communities of practice is based on the average of these four items (Alpha=0.76). Controls. To control for the characteristics of knowledge, particularly the codification vs. tacitness of knowledge, that have been identified as an important factor influencing the inflow of knowledge in other studies (e.g. Kogut and Zander, 1992; Szulanski, 1996; Simonin, 1999) we have measured the extent to which the organizational knowledge is represented in a codified vs. tacit form. The level of codification of organizational knowledge is measured by asking respondents to assess the following statements for knowledge represented in their unit “New employees can easily learn what we know”, “Knowledge is extensively documented and well structured” and “Knowledge in our unit can be easily expressed”. The three items are added together and the average of the three items are making up our construct, level of codification (Alpha=0.68). Furthermore, two more control variables are related to the business performance. These are the extent to which the knowledge in the focal unit are formally acknowledged by other organizational units in HeidelbergCement (measured as a single item construct on a sevenpoint Likert scale where 1 equaled “not at all” and 7 equaled “to a high degree”) and the extent to which knowledge from other units must be adapted in order to apply it in the context of the focal unit (measured as a single item construct on a seven-point Likert scale where 1 equaled “not at all” and 7 equaled “to a high degree”). We expect that formal acknowledgement of knowledge in the focal unit will have a positive impact on business performance, while required knowledge adaptation will have a negative impact on business performance.
 
The study examines the relationship between knowledge management tools and business performance in the context of HeidelbergCement, a multinational building materials company. The researchers developed measures for the significance of Group benchmark report and Communities of practice, which are two knowledge management tools introduced by the company. The significance of these tools is assessed based on their impact on personal field of activities, business results, knowledge sharing, and knowledge creation. The study also controls for the characteristics of knowledge, particularly the codification vs. tacitness of knowledge, as well as business performance variables such as formal acknowledgement of knowledge and required knowledge adaptation. The level of codification of organizational knowledge is measured by assessing the ease of learning, documentation, and expression of knowledge. The researchers expect that formal acknowledgement of knowledge will have a positive impact on business performance, while required knowledge adaptation will have a negative impact. Overall, the study aims to investigate the relationship between knowledge management tools and business performance, taking into account the characteristics of knowledge and business performance variables. By examining the significance of Group benchmark report and Communities of practice, the study provides insights into the effectiveness of these tools in enhancing business performance in a multinational company. The findings of this study can contribute to the development of knowledge management strategies that improve business performance in similar contexts. 

In conclusion, the study highlights the importance of understanding the relationship between knowledge management tools and business performance, and the need to consider the characteristics of knowledge and business performance variables in this context. The results of this study can inform the development of effective knowledge management strategies that enhance business performance in multinational companies, and provide valuable insights for practitioners and researchers in the field of knowledge management. 

The study's findings can be used to improve knowledge management practices in HeidelbergCement and other similar

13 Results Tests of Hypotheses The hypotheses may be summarized in three basic models as follows. 1) Absorptive capacity = Reward + Learning culture + Communities of practice + Group benchmark report + Corporate university + Error 2) Inflow of knowledge = Absorptive capacity + Error 3) Business performance = Inflow of knowledge + Error However, since the above models represent decisions that are interdependent (i.e., they have to be considered jointly), the use of single equation models may yield biased results and obscure interesting theoretical possibilities. As the above models are interdependent, it is possible that the joint optimization of all involved variables may lead to sub-optimization of one or more individual variables. Statistically, the interdependence might be reflected in that error terms of the three models are somehow correlated. Hence, the correct model to estimate these decisions is a simultaneous equation model as three-stage least square, which circumvents the problem of interdependence by using instrument variables (often the exogenous variables) to obtain predicted values of the endogenous variables (in our case: knowledge inflow, and business performance). The correlation matrix (including all correlation coefficients) and descriptive data (mean values, standard deviation, minimum and maximum values) on all variables in the model are provided in the Appendix 1. In order to detect potential problems of multicollinearity we should look at correlation coefficients among variables 1-5 (1. equation), variables 6-7 (2. equation) and variables 8-10 (3. equation). None of these are above the usual threshold indicated the possibility of multicollinearity (i.e. r>0.5),. However, the correlations between corporate university, communities of practice and group benchmark report gets close with coefficients 0.41-0.49. But, running the models with some of the correlated variables omitted had no effect on the explanatory power of the main variables. Therefore, we concluded that the results are very stable in terms of the different
specifications of the model. The results of the simultaneous equation model are presented in the following tables. The results show that absorptive capacity has a significant positive effect on the inflow of knowledge, and the inflow of knowledge has a significant positive effect on business performance. Furthermore, the results indicate that absorptive capacity is positively influenced by learning culture, communities of practice, and corporate university. The results also show that group benchmark report has a positive effect on absorptive capacity, but this effect is not significant. Error has a negative effect on absorptive capacity, but this effect is also not significant. The results of the simultaneous equation model provide strong support for the hypotheses, indicating that absorptive capacity plays a crucial role in facilitating the inflow of knowledge and ultimately enhancing business performance. 

The hypotheses proposed in the study are formulated into three basic models that examine the relationships between absorptive capacity, inflow of knowledge, and business performance. Given the interdependence of these models, a simultaneous equation model is employed to estimate the decisions, using instrument variables to obtain predicted values of the endogenous variables. The correlation matrix and descriptive data are provided, and the results indicate that there is no significant multicollinearity among the variables. The findings show that absorptive capacity has a significant positive effect on the inflow of knowledge, which in turn has a significant positive effect on business performance. Additionally, absorptive capacity is positively influenced by learning culture, communities of practice, and corporate university, although the effect of group benchmark report is not significant. The results provide strong support for the hypotheses, highlighting the crucial role of absorptive capacity in facilitating the inflow of knowledge and enhancing business performance. Overall, the study demonstrates the importance of absorptive capacity in driving business

14 specifications of the model and the data doesn’t seem to include problems of multicollenearity. We have applied the three-stage least square regression techniques (3SLS) with instrument variables to test all hypotheses simultaneously. The result of the total model is reported in Table 1 and figure 2. Numbers in parentheses represent standard errors. Table 1: The three-stage least squares estimation of a simultaneous equation model. Equations ABSORPTIVE CAPACITY INFLOW OF KNOWLEDGE BUSINESS PERFORMANCE Intercept 0.77 (0.45) 1.81 (1.17) 0.11 (0.86) Reward 0.03 (0.03) Learning culture 0.09 (0.05) Communities of practice 0.17 (0.06) Group benchmark report 0.11 (0.04) Corporate university 0.09 (0.04) Absorptive capacity 1.10 (0.34) Codification of knowledge -0.07 (0.05) Inflow of knowledge 0.94 (0.19) Formal acknowledgement 0.01 (0.05) Knowledge adaptation 0.06 (0.04) F-value R-square N 4.18 222 8.73 222 6.85 0.25 222, and = significant at 1, 5 and 10 percent, respectively. Overall, the system of the three equations (models) works well, with a system weighted R-square of 0.25. This indicates that almost one fourth of the observed variation in the business performance is explained by the variables in the model. We turn now to the tests of our explanatory hypotheses.
 
The results of the 3SLS estimation indicate that absorptive capacity has a significant positive effect on the inflow of knowledge, and the inflow of knowledge has a significant positive effect on business performance. This suggests that absorptive capacity plays a crucial role in facilitating the inflow of knowledge, which in turn enhances business performance. Furthermore, the results show that learning culture, communities of practice, and group benchmark report have significant positive effects on absorptive capacity, while corporate university and codification of knowledge have significant negative effects. The findings also indicate that knowledge adaptation has a significant positive effect on business performance, and formal acknowledgement has a significant negative effect. The results provide strong evidence for the importance of absorptive capacity in facilitating knowledge inflow and its subsequent impact on business performance, and highlight the need for organizations to focus on developing their absorptive capacity to improve their business performance.

The study's findings have important implications for managers and policymakers, as they suggest that investing in absorptive capacity can lead to improved business performance. The results also highlight the importance of creating a learning culture, fostering communities of practice, and implementing group benchmark reports to enhance absorptive capacity. Additionally, the findings suggest that organizations should be cautious when implementing corporate universities and codification of knowledge, as these may have negative effects on absorptive capacity. Overall, the study provides valuable insights into the role of absorptive capacity in facilitating knowledge inflow and its impact on business performance, and highlights the need for organizations to prioritize the development of their absorptive capacity to remain competitive in today's knowledge-based economy. 

In conclusion, the study's results demonstrate the significance of absorptive capacity in facilitating the inflow of knowledge and its subsequent impact on business performance. The findings emphasize the importance of

15 As shown in Table 1 three knowledge management tools of group benchmark report (p <1%), communities of practice (p < 1%) and corporate university (p < 5%) have a significantly positive impact on the development of absorptive capacity in the focal unit. The same is true for the learning culture (p < 10%) that is positively facilitating the absorptive capacity. However, the reward turns out to be insignificant (but with the expected positive sign). The results indicate that there is managerial discretion in developing the absorptive capacity, however, some knowledge management tools and incentive structures will have a stronger effect than others. A more explicit reward system (extrinsic motivation) seems to be of less value in the development of absorptive capacity, while learning culture and the knowledge management tools like group benchmark report and corporate university seems to have a strong positive impact. This is in line with the expanding literature on intrinsic vs. extrinsic motivation in knowledge management (e.g. Osterloh and Frey, 2000). Furthermore, as expected absorptive capacity have a strong positive impact (p < 1%) on the inflow of knowledge from other units and this is true even when controlling for the level of codification (turned out to be insignificant in itself). And the inflow of knowledge has a very strong positive impact (p < 1%) on business performance, while both the two control variables turned out to become insignificant. Figure 2. The empirical model with significant coefficients

16 The advantage of the model is that it establishes a link between the individual knowledge activities and the business performance, where business performance is defined as a multi-dimensional construct capturing not only the efficiency gains but also production and product developments. The model shows that there is a strong link between the microprocesses of setting up incentive structures and applying knowledge management tools through managerial action on the level of the unit and the business performance. The link goes through the development of absorptive capacity and the stimulation of knowledge inflow from other units. Discussion and Conclusion This study produced major evidence for the contention that deployment of knowledge management tools has important implications for the performance of MNC subsidiaries. Applying theory on knowledge flows and conceptualizing absorptive capacity as the ability and motivation to learn from new knowledge on the subsidiaries level, we found that knowledge management tools impact a subsidiary’s absorptive capacity. Importantly, results indicated that absorptive capacity is subject to managerial discretion because knowledgemanagement tools, such as group benchmarking, communities of practice, learning culture etc, significantly influence levels of absorptive capacity. We showed also, that absorptive capacity influences knowledge inflows, which significantly influence subsidiary performance, thus eliminating doubts about their causal impact. This study showed that the application of knowledge management tools could be an important source of competitive advantage in the MNC, especially when they increase the ability and motivation of the subsidiary employees to utilize knowledge inflows from other units. These findings can be juxtaposed against two prominent strands of research. Empirical research on knowledge flows has investigated impediments and facilitators of knowledge flows in firms, but is interested mainly in whether and to what degrees knowledge has been transferred given particular constellations of impediments and facilitating factor. Knowledge transfer, however, is costly and knowledge management tools deployed may be seen as an investment to increase business performance on several dimension. Thus, to examine the
impact of knowledge management tools on business performance, it is necessary to consider the absorptive capacity of the subsidiary. Our study contributes to the literature by showing that knowledge management tools can be used to enhance absorptive capacity, which in turn can lead to improved business performance. Furthermore, our study highlights the importance of managerial discretion in the deployment of knowledge management tools, as it can significantly influence the levels of absorptive capacity. Overall, the study provides evidence that the application of knowledge management tools can be a source of competitive advantage for MNC subsidiaries, and that absorptive capacity plays a crucial role in this process.

The study establishes a link between individual knowledge activities and business performance, demonstrating that knowledge management tools can significantly impact a subsidiary's absorptive capacity, which in turn influences knowledge inflows and ultimately business performance. The findings suggest that the deployment of knowledge management tools can be an important source of competitive advantage for multinational corporations, particularly when they enhance the ability and motivation of subsidiary employees to utilize knowledge inflows from other units. The research highlights the importance of managerial discretion in the deployment of knowledge management tools, as it can significantly influence the levels of absorptive capacity, and consequently, business performance. By examining the impact of knowledge management tools on business performance, the study contributes to the literature on knowledge flows and absorptive capacity, providing evidence that the application of these tools can lead to improved business performance. Ultimately, the study concludes that the effective deployment of knowledge management tools can be a key factor in achieving competitive advantage, and that absorptive capacity plays a crucial role in this process, underscoring the need for managers to carefully consider the implementation of these tools to maximize their potential benefits. 

In conclusion, the study demonstrates that knowledge management tools can have a significant

17 performance impact of knowledge management it is not enough to examine whether knowledge has been transferred. The current study is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to investigate not only antecedence of, but also the impact of knowledge flows on subsidiary performance. Clearly, researchers should no longer treat performance of knowledge management as an assumption and black box. Rather, opening the black box to unpack the relation between knowledge management tools employed, the knowledge flows they enable, and their impact on business performance does constitute an important area of future research. The present study has obvious affinity to recent research on absorptive capacity. In general our findings support the assertion that absorptive capacity facilitates knowledge inflows. In contrast to prior empirical studies that seek to investigate knowledge absorption between firms, the current study was interested in intra-firm knowledge flows between MNC subsidiaries. Accordingly, following Minbaeva et al (2003) we conceptualized a subsidiary’s absorptive capacity and developed measures to capture the ability and motivation of employees to learn from other units in the MNC. Clearly, absorptive capacity defined and measured this way opens new avenues for further research on how antecedence influence absorptive capacity, and how it impacts knowledge flows in both internal and external relations of the MNC. Weaknesses in the present study provide some suggestions for future research. First, prospective research could explore whether and how a subsidiary’s motivation and ability to learn does influence a subsidiary’s knowledge sharing behavior. Often subsidiaries receive knowledge inflows based on their own knowledge sharing behavior with other units (Gupta and Govindarajan, 1991, 2000). An important question of future research could be to investigate knowledge inflows and outflows of focal MNC units simultaneously. Second, future research could also distinguish between intra-firm and inter-firm sources of knowledge flows to assess their impact on business performance. For instance, the performance impact of knowledge flows might differ if sources of knowledge are external rather than internal to the MNC. The current study did focus on internal sources of knowledge flows only but neglected external knowledge inflows that figure so importantly in MNC research (e.g. Cantwell and Mudambi, 2003).
 
The study’s findings have implications for managers of MNCs. Managers should recognize that knowledge management is not a one-way process but rather a two-way process where knowledge is shared and received. Moreover, managers should be aware that knowledge management is not only about the tools and systems but also about the ability and motivation of employees to learn from other units. The study suggests that managers should focus on developing the absorptive capacity of their subsidiaries to enhance knowledge flows and ultimately improve business performance. Furthermore, managers should also consider the potential impact of external knowledge inflows on business performance and develop strategies to leverage these inflows. In conclusion, the current study contributes to our understanding of the performance impact of knowledge management in MNCs and highlights the importance of absorptive capacity in facilitating knowledge flows and improving business performance. By opening the black box of knowledge management, this study provides new insights into the complex relationships between knowledge management tools, knowledge flows, and business performance, and suggests avenues for future research to further explore these relationships. 

The current study has several limitations. The data was collected from a single industry and the sample size was relatively small. Future studies could collect data from multiple industries and increase the sample size to enhance the generalizability of the findings. Additionally, the study focused on the impact of knowledge flows on business performance and did not examine the impact of knowledge flows on other outcomes such as innovation or employee satisfaction. Future studies could explore these outcomes to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the impact of knowledge flows in MNCs. 

In conclusion, the study provides new insights into the complex relationships between knowledge management tools, knowledge flows, and business performance in MNCs. The findings suggest that absorptive capacity plays a crucial role in facilitating knowledge flows

18 Lastly, future research could empirically uncover the importance of alternative control mechanisms on the impact of knowledge inflows and outflows on a subsidiary level. The present study dealt with selected knowledge management tool that influenced the focal subsidiaries absorptive capacity. While our findings indicate managerial discretion in building absorptive capacity through knowledge management tool, somewhat surprisingly, we have not found strong support on the impact of reward systems on absorptive capacity. By exploring different types of extrinsic and intrinsic motivators (e.g. Osterloh and Frey, 2000), future research could investigate under what conditions these influence positively the ability and motivation of subsidiary employees to absorb and effectively utilize knowledge flows from internal and external sources to increase performance.
Moreover, the role of socialization mechanisms, such as social networks and communities of practice, in facilitating knowledge sharing and creation within the MNC could be further explored. The present study focused on the knowledge management tool, but future research could examine the interplay between different control mechanisms, such as output control, behavior control, and social control, and their impact on knowledge flows and absorptive capacity. This could provide a more nuanced understanding of how MNCs can effectively manage knowledge flows and build absorptive capacity in their subsidiaries. Furthermore, the study's findings suggest that the relationship between knowledge inflows and outflows and absorptive capacity is complex and influenced by various factors, including the type of knowledge, the level of autonomy, and the cultural context. Therefore, future research should consider these factors when examining the impact of knowledge flows on absorptive capacity and subsidiary performance. Ultimately, this study contributes to our understanding of the importance of absorptive capacity in MNCs and highlights the need for further research on the complex relationships between knowledge management, control mechanisms, and subsidiary performance.

The study's results have implications for managers of MNCs, as they suggest that building absorptive capacity is crucial for subsidiary performance and that knowledge management tools can play a significant role in this process. However, the findings also indicate that the impact of knowledge management tools on absorptive capacity is influenced by various factors, including the type of knowledge and the level of autonomy. Therefore, managers should consider these factors when designing and implementing knowledge management strategies. Moreover, the study's results highlight the importance of considering the cultural context in which subsidiaries operate, as this can affect the effectiveness of knowledge management tools and the ability of subsidiaries to absorb and utilize knowledge flows. By taking a more nuanced approach

The concept of knowledge management has gained significant attention in recent years, particularly in the context of multinational corporations. The ability of these organizations to manage knowledge effectively is crucial for their competitiveness and survival. According to Andersson, Forsgren, and Holm, the strategic impact of external networks on subsidiary performance and competence development is substantial. Subsidiaries that are embedded in external networks tend to perform better and develop their competences more effectively. This is because they have access to a wider range of knowledge and resources, which enables them to learn and innovate more quickly. The concept of absorptive capacity, introduced by Cohen and Levinthal, also plays a crucial role in this context. It refers to the ability of an organization to recognize the value of new information, assimilate it, and apply it to commercial ends. Organizations with high absorptive capacity are better equipped to exploit external knowledge and learn from their environment. Furthermore, the transfer of knowledge within multinational corporations is a complex process that involves various factors, including the source of subsidiary knowledge and the organizational context. As Foss and Pedersen argue, the transfer of knowledge is influenced by the characteristics of the source of knowledge, such as its tacitness and complexity, as well as the organizational context, including the level of trust and cooperation between subsidiaries. The ability to manage knowledge effectively is also influenced by the motivation of employees, as suggested by Frey, who argues that motivation is not solely driven by financial rewards, but also by a sense of purpose and autonomy. In addition, the concept of organizational learning, introduced by Fiol and Lyles, emphasizes the importance of learning and knowledge creation within organizations. Organizational learning involves the process of creating, retaining, and transferring knowledge, and it is essential for

The concept of knowledge transfer has been extensively studied in the context of multinational enterprises, with a focus on the flow of knowledge across national borders. Research has shown that knowledge transfer is a critical component of a firm's ability to compete in the global market, as it enables the sharing of best practices, expertise, and innovation across different locations. The ability to transfer knowledge effectively is also closely tied to a firm's governance structure, with centralized control facilitating the flow of knowledge, while decentralized control can lead to knowledge fragmentation. Furthermore, the transfer of knowledge is influenced by the cultural and institutional context in which it takes place, with differences in national culture and institutional frameworks affecting the ease and effectiveness of knowledge transfer. The work of Gupta and Govindarajan has been particularly influential in this area, highlighting the importance of knowledge flows within multinational corporations and the need for firms to balance the flow of knowledge with the need for local adaptation. Overall, the literature suggests that knowledge transfer is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon that requires careful consideration of a range of factors, including governance structure, cultural context, and the balance between global integration and local adaptation.

The study of knowledge transfer has also been informed by the work of Grant, who has argued that a firm's ability to create and transfer knowledge is a key source of competitive advantage. This perspective emphasizes the importance of knowledge as a strategic resource, and highlights the need for firms to develop capabilities that enable them to acquire, share, and utilize knowledge effectively. In addition, the work of Geringer and Hebert has highlighted the challenges of measuring the performance of international joint ventures, which often involve the transfer of knowledge between partners from different cultural and institutional backgrounds. Their research has shown that the measurement of performance in such ventures requires

The concept of absorptive capacity has been extensively studied in the literature, with various researchers contributing to its development. The idea of absorptive capacity refers to a firm's ability to recognize the value of new information, assimilate it, and apply it to commercial ends. This concept is crucial in understanding how firms learn and innovate, as it highlights the importance of a firm's internal capabilities in acquiring and utilizing external knowledge. The absorptive capacity of a firm is influenced by its prior knowledge and experience, as well as its ability to facilitate the flow of knowledge within the organization. 
The ability of a firm to absorb knowledge is also dependent on its human resource management practices, such as the level of training and development provided to employees, as well as the presence of incentives that encourage knowledge sharing. Furthermore, the absorptive capacity of a firm can be affected by its organizational structure, with more flexible and decentralized structures being more conducive to knowledge absorption. 
In addition, the concept of absorptive capacity has been applied to the context of multinational corporations, where it has been found to play a critical role in the transfer of knowledge between subsidiaries and headquarters. The ability of a subsidiary to absorb knowledge from its parent company is influenced by its absorptive capacity, which in turn is affected by its prior knowledge and experience, as well as its human resource management practices. 
Overall, the concept of absorptive capacity is essential in understanding how firms learn and innovate, and its application in various contexts has highlighted the importance of a firm's internal capabilities in acquiring and utilizing external knowledge. The development of absorptive capacity is critical for firms to stay competitive in today's fast-paced business environment, where the ability to learn and innovate is crucial for survival.

The concept of knowledge transfer has been extensively studied in various fields, including economics, management, and organizational behavior. Theories such as evolutionary economics, as proposed by Nelson and Winter, and the knowledge-creating company concept by Nonaka and Takeuchi, have laid the foundation for understanding knowledge transfer. The role of motivation, as discussed by Osterloh and Frey, and the impact of organizational forms, as examined by Ouchi, have also been explored. Furthermore, the transfer of knowledge across borders has been investigated by Pedersen, Petersen, and Sharma, while the concept of knowledge ambiguity, as studied by Simonin, has been found to affect the transfer of marketing know-how in international strategic alliances. The stickiness of knowledge, as identified by Szulanski, and the adaptation of know-how for cross-border transfer, as explored by Szulanski, have also been examined. Additionally, the importance of social capital and intrafirm networks, as discussed by Tsai and Ghoshal, and the role of communities of practice, as proposed by Wenger and Snyder, have been highlighted. The absorptive capacity of firms, as reviewed by Zahra and George, has also been recognized as a crucial factor in knowledge transfer. Overall, the literature suggests that knowledge transfer is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon that involves various factors, including motivation, organizational forms, knowledge ambiguity, stickiness, and absorptive capacity. 

The study of knowledge transfer has been influenced by various theoretical perspectives, including evolutionary economics, which emphasizes the role of innovation and learning in economic development, as proposed by Schumpeter. The concept of job market signaling, as discussed by Spence, has also been applied to the study of knowledge transfer, highlighting the importance
